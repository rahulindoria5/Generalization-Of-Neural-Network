# Generalization-Of-Neural-Network
Neural network with variable number of layers and nodes without using any neural network library.

Here, I am creating a neural network without using any neural network library. Here, you can create any number of layers and any number of nodes within the layer. Here, I am using "Iris dataset" for classification.
